Recently, this Bank (called RBL Bank) was recognized by the World Economic Forum as a Global Growth Company, 2014. Antilles has an unrealized return of 49% IRR in this investment. Antilles' specialty is in identifying investment opportunities in India that are grossly under-priced (with respect to its value) or because of some structural market issues and invest in these opportunities for a 5-year period. Due to our unique legal structure of investments, Investors can make very high returns (in the range of 30%+ p.a.) and receive these returns tax-free in the USA. Current Investment opportunities include various companies in diverse sectors (e.g. Infrastructure, consumption/ FMCG, E-Commerce/ Technology) that have the potential to generate high returns over the next 3-5 year period. The Principal in Antilles Advisors has very deep business and commercial relationships in India that allow him to discover and invest in these opportunities before the broader market discovers these opportunities. One of the most promising investment opportunities include an Utility firm that is trading at US$ 40 million market cap, when the company has assets worth US$ 2 billion.

When a child wearing one of our shirts wanders off, the B’ZT App issues alarms to prevent any missing child.  Most of the tracking devices in the market are expensive with monthly subscription fees, and battery recharging is required. They are easy to loose and uncomfortable to wear especially for young children. In contrast, B'zT's washable tracking device is pre-embedded in a t-shirt. You can machine wash it, you don't need to recharge the battery. There is no subscription fee. B'zT's application of technology is non-intrusive and so simple that you don't even think it's a tracking device. You can treat B'zT just as a regular t-shirt and enjoy all the benefits of the technology.  After a lost-and-found experience that Kiyeon had with her 3-year-old daughter at a shopping center, she was shocked to find that most tracking devices are expensive with monthly subscription plan. As a mother of two children and a 20 year fashion industry veteran in New York City, she decided to develop a tracking device that is affordable, machine washable, has no battery recharging required, allows group tracking, and works anywhere in the world. After filing a patent in 2015, she and her team worked hard to bring B'zT to the market where it has already received recognition as one of the top tracking solutions. One of the drawbacks of conventional tracking devices is the fact that they are easy to loose. Between charging and paying monthly fees for maintenance, parents and caregivers gets frustrated when the battery runs out or forgot to charge when you need to use. What if a parent has 5 children to monitor or a teacher has 30 students to track on a field trip? what if a whole entire school wants to monitor children every day in a least intrusive way? What if parent wash tracking device as if it's a regular clothing? Now with B'zT, for the first time in human history, we can do this all for our children's safety. Despite just coming into the market in 2017, B'zT has already received recognition from PC Magazine and others as one of the top tracker solutions for children. B'zT was honored to receive a Female Founder Recognition Award from Greylock Partners and TechCrunch, Edison Award Nominee for 2019 and obtained NYC DOE vendor's license in 2018. Through numerous presentations to school PTA, B'zT has been gaining recognitions by parents and teachers and laying foundations for B2B sales. Several schools in Korea has adopted B'zT school system and a private school in Flushing adopted the system. B'zT's website and Amazon store are showing steady increase in sales. B'zT is an integration of 100% Cotton t-shirt and 100% biodegradable eco friendly chipset molding. B’zT® Chipset is designed with battery activation button which allows battery power to last up to a year. B’zT's innovative molding material allows B’zT’s intricate electronic circuits to be protected from multiple washes so that from the perspective of parents and children, B'zT is just like any another t-shirt. B'zT believes when technology in the backdrop is non-intrusive, we can emphasize the positive means of human connection and provide children the sense of safety, security and confidence.",,,

This should be a time every teenager looks forward to without any worry of violence or crime because they are being attentively protected for the case of extreme danger. Right now, that isn’t entirely true.” - Sean Levinson, Elite Daily, April 11, 2013 Never-Before-Offered, In-The-Moment, Mobile Conflict Resolution & Mediation Caroami is an online conflict resolution and mediation platform operated through a messaging interface. It uses Crowdsourcing, AI, and Machine Learning to resolve conflicts in-the-moment, before they escalate, such as roommate disputes, dating issues, ghosted friendships, unfriended pals, gender politics, and sexual harassment. The millennial market looks for an instant, mobile, and electronic solution to conflict.  $2.9B Market Opportunity Higher education institutions are in turmoil, and Caroami is ready to step in to help at this pivotal time with our unique offering. The college experience has always been demanding, and students face a range of interpersonal problems that determine their success or failure. Add to that the effect mobile and social technology has had on the social skills of students entering college in recent years leaving them without adequate negotiating or communication skills to resolve disputes. Even though 98% of the 83.1M Millenials in the US use a smartphone, there is no digital tool on the market that provides an instant, mobile, or confidential way to help them resolve interpersonal conflict. Traditional, off-line mediation solutions are time-intensive, cumbersome, and extremely costly. In addition to higher education, Caroami is poised to serve corporate users, HOAs, courts, government, and the military with a market potential of $2.9B and growing. The future of conflict resolution is digital, instantaneous, and mobile, and is currently not being adequately served. Workplace discrimination against employees based on race, gender, or sexual orientation costs businesses an estimated $64 billion annually, not including the cost to their reputation or workplace morale. When companies buy harassment insurance, they are not protecting the victims. Caroami protects both the end user and the organization. Value Proposition From frazzled to happy, students can now use Caroami to resolve their roommate disputes, gender politics, sexual harassment, and other issues at the moment with our messaging interface-based mobile which replaces the slow, inadequate, and rather public Facebook and Twitter apps they are currently using for this purpose. Colleges, universities, and other organizations can avoid costly settlements, expensive lawyers, and hits to their reputations with the help of our app that affordably uses Crowdsourcing, AI, and ML to guide students to de-escalate potential violence and restore relationships that have gone awry. It also has applications in cases of gender, religion, and identity politics that pose legal, PR nightmares, and attrition, all while keeping problems internal to the organization.  Happy students turn into happy alumni and future donors. Paying clients will receive data/analytics to better plan next academic year. Employers can identify and prevent problems way before they escalate. Students will learn to resolve conflicts over time, promote wellness, and preserve friendships. Tri-Revenue Model Using a B2B, SaaS model, we offer: 1.	Freemium and Premium services with an analytics add-on for a licensing agreement 2.	Additional wellness and safety modules 3.

If wealth is defined as “the repertoire of physical transformations that one is capable of causing (David Deutsch)” then this reduction in friction should lead to a massive increase in wealth. Large projects are usually designed and managed from the top down. Cynch helps remove the top down nature of project management.  Once a project has been orchestrated and the work to be performed has been documented, Cynch will allow the work to be dynamically executed through a set of smart contracts.  These smart contracts allow for an approach to projects that we call “Just in Time Execution.” Blockchain technologies and the decentralization that they enable will create significant disruption across many industries in the coming years.  Fundamental to this movement is the ability to execute value transfers in a trustless environment.  Our CynchTask Contracts abstract work orchestration into a few basic api endpoints.  We pair this abstraction with a dynamic and robust orchestration platform, Cynch, that has its roots in robust project management system and is already in use by major corporations.  These orchestrations further enable capturing value in many ways including: Reduced friction in resource verification and compensation.   Define a blockchain of custody for work objects. Create a shared data space that streamlines auditing and the sharing of reports. Once an ecosystem of market participants develop around doing work on the Cynch platform we can create additional value by gamifying negotiations using a decentralized request for proposal(RFP) management platform. The system will eventually develop a rich set of data that can packaged and sold in a data market to project managers seeking to bid and scope upcoming projects. The Cynch system will be based upon an open source protocol that will allow third party developers to add value to the system by creating Dapps and other system integrations that are beyond the capacity and expertise of the core Cynch team.

The platform gives users core atomic functionality out-of-the-box that vastly improves overall performance for portfolio managers who want to deploy capital strategically and efficiently. No subscription or registration is required to get started. If funds are held in MPC wallets like Fireblocks or Qredo, traders simply connect to the platform via WalletConnect or Metamask. Traders rely on Dexible full life cycle trade support for their dex swaps and accounting management. Dexible's 7 order types draw inspiration from those offered in traditional finance including TWAP/DCA, Stop Limit, Stop Loss, Take Profit, and Limit Orders. The Dexible aggregator pulls liquidity from 57 AMMs to make swaps possible and uses a smart order router to determine the best pricing across 5 different networks. Automated trading leads to far superior outcomes for strategies trading in long-tail assets. Some unique use cases the platform introduces include rug pull protection, buying dips in prices, price bounded Dollar Cost Averaging, minimizing transaction fees, preserving profits, and illiquid market swaps. The Dexible team repurposed infrastructure from a signals composition engine designed for Ethereum devs into automated trading after the CDL accelerator in the summer of 2020. Today, Dexible's infrastructure evaluates multichain market conditions 24/7. The platform automatically evaluates parent orders and splits up the total input to reduce total swap slippage by up to 30%. Orders have custom algorithms based on trader’s criteria boiled down to True-False policies. Traders get detailed pre-trade estimates and post-trade analytics to improve decision-making.",,,

We’re disrupting the Hollywood studio model. With budgets soaring, original content is risky because it lacks brand awareness. Meanwhile, analysts and executives agree: the cycle of sequels and remakes is presenting increasing danger to industry profitability. In addition, there is tremendous waste built into the Hollywood system.  Executives and analysts agree: Hollywood spends at least twice what it should making films. Gramarye has recognized that these issues provide an opportunity for disruption. Our process is based on three core concepts: 1.	Reduce Risk — Discover original content with a built-in, proven audience 2.	Produce Content at a Significantly Lower Cost for multiple cross-media channels in concert to open new opportunities for revenue generation  3.	Own access to Distribution Channels All three pillars will generate revenue. Blockchain Technology Gramarye makes disruptive use of blockchain technology in two ways:  •	First, Gramarye’s SEC-Compliant ICO raise makes us the first major studio funded by a cryptocurrency offer. It’s not just a Gramarye raise — we’re investing in a complete ecosystem of partner companies, each of which expand our capabilities and return dividends to token holders. Second, Gramarye uses blockchain utility tokens (which cannot be purchased) to provide meaningful rewards and incentives to fan evangelists who spark the viral spread of brand awareness, and to stream content directly to consumers hungry for the core, generational stories that unite us all.

The project will be launched in two stages. The first stage is a concierge service IamOn, which helps contractors find clients and build user interest in the business model. This will be launched in May 2015. At the same time the team is working on the second stage of the project that includes the architectural design of the decentralized blockchain platform.  It is based on the blockchain system, which enables users to collaborate through smart contacts.  The platform is a distributed, community-owned database. It has improved security, and does not rely on external resources. The launch date for the second stage will be announced later in 2015. IamOn plans to become a global, decentralized service exchange, where the search for professionals and clients will be implemented with help of database mining algorithms at the level of secured P2P processes. The platform takes people out of the loop and passes the work to an automated system, which will synchronize client requests with contractor data in real time and find the most relevant offers to create a match. There are four simple steps to connect a potential client with a service provider: A business owner registers their initial data including location, type of services, price list and other information that will be used as a filter. A potential client creates an contract, indicating their own criteria and the timeframe. All the information will sit on a cryptographic blockchain, which means that nobody will be able to access it. Whenever a client and a service provider are matched with the help of data mining algorithms, only the part of the information that is necessary and public will be available between them. The client and the potential contractor can communicate privately and make a deal in terms of contract. The IamOn platform solves the problems of both parties. It offers SMB a free channel to interact with customers and it provides customers with up-to-date information and a quick contractor search with no hidden fees. Features: • All system participants are businesses and clients and can independently manage their privacy level.   • The system will have internal tokens, Bitcoins, to prevent abuse. People will be awarded Bitcoins for hosting the blockchain which they can spend to create or accept a contract. This approach will prevent hacking and spam. • Third-party services are able to create applications for blockchain collaboration though an open API.",,,

Three Tree Ventures prefers to invest in startups as early as possible, exclusively invests in product companies, and prefers to invest in organizations with one or more U.S. military veteran founder(s), and/or women and minority-founded startups.  Mr. Carpenter is a globally respected cyber security expert with a broad range of successful early-stage investments, including Compass (04/01/2021 IPO NYSE:COMP @ $8.22B valuation), GroupSense, White Ops (acquired by Goldman Sachs Merchant Banking), Dark Cubed, uSTADIUM, PeerNova, MILLIE, Rumi Spice, Awake Security (acquired by Arista Networks), Privateer Holdings (acquired by TILRAY), ThreatGRID (acquired by Cisco Systems), RideScout (acquired by Daimler AG), InAuth (acquired by American Express) and Efflux Systems (acquired by NETSCOUT Systems). Mr. Carpenter is known for his acumen for advising early stage innovators. He has successfully helped raise capital, navigate rough waters, acquire key talent and customers, and help develop short and long-term strategies for portfolio companies and startups that he advises. He is currently an Advisor to CrossCut Ventures, Trinity Cyber, TruSTAR Technology (acquired by Splunk), GroupSense, uSTADIUM, MILLIE, Cannecht, and Netswitch Technology Management. He has also been a Limited Partner at CrossCut Ventures for 7+ years, and is also a CrossCut Scout. He has held key positions at startups where he was an early employee — Principal Forensics Analyst at NetWitness Corporation (acquired by EMC/RSA), Chief Technical Analyst at iSIGHT Partners (acquired by FireEye), Chief Strategy Officer at Invotas (aquired by FireEye), and Senior Vice President of Cyber at Cybraics. One of his greatest passions is being the Technical Advisor for a non-profit 501(c)3 founded by his wife, Dr. Jennifer Jacobs, and a close friend, Jessica Stern — Connect Our Kids (https://www.connectourkids.org). The non-profit is applying modern technologies like artificial intelligence and data science to the foster care system in the United States to improve placement outcomes -- finding forever families for thousands of children in the system.  His experience and successful entrepreneurial background are coupled with deep technical skills honed while pioneering cyber security protocols for the federal government and working at NetWitness and iSIGHT Partners over the past two decades. Shawn is also a veteran of the U.S. Navy, and qualified as a nuclear operator and chemist during his six years of service in the U.S. Navy's Nuclear Propulsion Program (NNPS Class 9203). Shawn also worked as a senior cyber security analyst for almost six years as a Member of the Technical Staff (MTS) at Sandia National Laboratories. He discovered one of the first documented penetrations of U.S. Government networks. After joining NetWitness as one of the first employees, he helped architect, implement and stand up the Justice Security Operations Center (JSOC) — at the time the largest deployment of NetWitness gear for a federal client. Mr. Carpenter also worked as a Principal Senior Analyst at the U.S. Department of State's Cyber Threat Analysis Team (CTAD) from 2004-2007. He was a key member of the 2005 CTAD team that was awarded the prestigious Frank B. Rowlett Trophy For Organizational Achievement by the National Security Agency (https://apps.nsa.gov/iaarchive/programs/rowlett-awards/recipients.cfm).  Mr. Carpenter has been tinkering with computers since his mother bought him his first computer, a TRS-80 Model I, in late 1978 at the age of 10 . He has been curious about almost everything since he was born, and enjoys playing slide guitar, harmonica, banjo and trumpet, metal detecting with his kids, building forts high in tall trees, lucid dreaming, experimenting with brain/machine interfaces, building robotics projects with his kids, and hacking all of the things. Mr. Carpenter has a particular affection for blues and jazz, and is an investor and Minor Partner in a John Coltrane biography — ""Chasing Trane"" (https://www.coltranefilm.com). His investments span everything from being the first money in at Rumi Spice (https://www.rumispice.com), a sustainable saffron growing enterprise founded by three West Point graduates, to PeerNova, a blockchain startup founded by his CS251 instructor from University of Nebraska. Five years after investing in Rumi Spice, it is now the largest private employer of Afghan women in the world, with over 2000 women employees. In May 2017, Mark Cuban became an investor in the saffron startup. In September of 2018, Rumi Spice's saffron became available nationwide in all Whole Food Markets.  Shawn is a native of Sioux Falls, SD, and credits his Mother, Jan, high school marching band instructor, David Haugen, South Dakota roots, and industry mentors and friends like Aaron Walters, Jaci Tomek, Amit Yoran, Dug Song, Gary Golomb, Chris Lukas, Sean Catlett, Richard Stiennon, Paul Garrett, Fraser Verrusio, and many others for his scrappiness and successes.",,,

We're not only building a better, more engaging fitness app where you can challenge your friends, compete in contests, and support charities with your activity. We're setting out to fix the broken app economy, and we've built the model and the infrastructure to build a movement across an entire ecosystem.   For us, this started by recognizing that it's the users that give apps their value.  Not the app's features.  Not their code.  The users.  Without users, an app is worthless.   Many apps offer their app to users for free in exchange for the right to advertise to those users.  So users get a free and convenient product.  But they give up control over their data, and all the value generated goes to the app company and the app company’s shareholders.  Those shareholders enjoy a significant multiple on user-derived metrics like monthly active users and revenue per thousand ads served to users.  So app companies work hard to maximize users' time and attention so they can acquire more data and serve more ads.  Users become the products, and are often subjected to psychological manipulation and other exploitation by app companies.  All in service to increasing value for shareholders.   Users can vote with their feet, but usually there's no better alternative and quite often there's no alternative at all.  So the preferences of users - manipulated in any event as they are - have little bearing on this system.   If users are a necessary condition for value, but users are exploited and have little to no control over the system that defines that value, then the system is overdue for a realignment.   So we asked ourselves some questions.  What if advertisers had to pay users to advertise to them?   What if apps were co-owned by their user communities?   What if users controlled their data and privacy?     What would that ecosystem have to look like?   What types of organizations are needed?   What do the relationships between them look like? And why shouldn’t the whole system prioritize our planet and a social purpose? If we were to build a single app to address these questions we’d bet it would not only be viable but could also inspire others to build new models and change existing ones.  And that would be a small success.  But a platform; a whole ecosystem of apps, united in a common commitment and shared principles just might be able to deliver lasting, systemic change.   Fit for All is a benefits company, committed to people, planet, and purpose, with ESG built into its DNA.  Run2Play is the fitness app created by Fit for All that will catalyze the ecosystem.   We created the AVA Foundation to generate and manage a token that can be used across an ecosystem of apps.  An adaptive reward engine allocates AVA Coin to users in proportion to their eligible activity.  AVA Coin can be used to purchase in-app advertising space, used for in-app and sponsor purchases, and traded among users and on exchanges, providing value and utility to the coin.  Each user selects up to three charitable causes to support, with the Climate Crisis preselected for all users, who donate 30-100% of their AVA Coin rewards, making seamless charitable giving a foundational element of the ecosystem.   While each component of the system is essential and complementary, the most innovative and important is the For All Cooperative.  Formed in Colorado, the For All Cooperative is a multi-stakeholder cooperative composed of users, app companies, the AVA Foundation, and investors, each in four distinct classes of membership, with the investor class limited in equity and voting power.  The app company membership agreement requires app companies to transfer increments of equity to the Cooperative proportional to Cooperative users acquired, up to 15%.  The app company membership agreement also obligates them to accept AVA Coin for advertising placements, in-app purchases, subscriptions, and other services proportionate to AVA Coin rewarded for user activity in their apps, also up to 15%, after which it is burned.  The Cooperative’s backend, Core, enables a single sign-on for all Circle Apps and an ad module that provides advertisers with anonymized but granular ad targeting for users who opt-in.  The Coopertive’s app, Conduit, provides social and gamification components to user-members, enables voting on Cooperative initiatives, as well as a marketplace for Circle Apps.",,,

Paying via debit at the PoS in CO, CA, and other more developed industries exists, however, these systems operate as disguised ATMs, and incur many different fees as a result. This leads to a markup of >$10-15 in most cases. Rhizomatiq is a DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) Utility Token based on the DAG-Tangle architecture; this allows for high efficiency, resistance to attacks, environmentally green operations and most importantly an incredibly high throughput rate for instant transaction authorization. Built on top of the DLT is a suite of Supply Chain Track/Trace algorithms that provide transparency up the Cannabis Supply Chain for Regulators, Consumers, Suppliers, and Merchants alike. This suite is a logistics tracing mechanism, that follows batches of tested Cannabis products throughout the distribution process; from seed, to sale. Rhizomatiq aims to streamline this process, and act as a base for the Cannabis industry to build on. Due to the efficiency and scalability of the DAG-Tangle architecture, we are able to offer extraordinarily low fees (.25% S2M / $1 C2M per Tx), and instantly approved transactions. The process is simple and intuitive. SEND / RECEIVE transaction pairs represent completed ""seeds"". These seeds are stored on ""nodes"", our word for the Account Tangle architecture. Transactions on the node are verified using a standard Random Selection algorithm. Before either a SEND or RECEIVE transaction is sent, a dense regulatory compliance process is completed in which the Account Holder's ability to partake in the transaction is verified. Rhizomatiq Tokens are Utility Tokens, therefore transactions are initiated as payment transfers to and from the senders and receivers payment methods, respectfully, and the Tokens themselves will never be able to be Bought or Sold.",,,

However, web3 is quickly gaining popularity and has the potential to revolutionize how we eat out. In the current landscape, restaurant owners create and market their NFT using **Opensea**, and then users have to find their NFT and create a wallet to collect these NFTs, which have no direct benefits. This is a problem, as we are currently seeing users lose interest in NFTs because they do not understand their value or how to use them effectively. [According to Square](https://squareup.com/us/en/townsquare/restaurant-trends#:~:text=%236.-,Restaurants%20are%20rethinking%20experiences%20to%20build%20deep%20customer%20loyalty,-Restaurants%20are%20coming), **Restaurants are rethinking experiences to build deep customer loyalty and drive sales. This is especially important for restaurants trying to create a differentiated experience in their category, which is the majority of restaurants today. The goal is to create an experience that makes customers feel like they are part of something special and exclusive.  NFTs can provide this experience by giving customers access to experiences they can’t get anywhere else.** [**Starbucks recently announced that they are adopting web3 as a reward system**](https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/starbucks-is-about-to-make-a-controversial-change-to-its-rewards-program-some-customers-are-going-to-love-it.html). This means that many non-crypto natives will be able to experiment with crypto assets without missing out on the most critical aspect of blockchain; decentralization and trustless systems. In addition, by providing users with the ability to use their NFTs as utilities, Starbucks would be able to generate more customer loyalty and engagement. This integration will also allow Starbucks to expand its reach into different markets where it previously had no presence.

Welcome to Aballoon, the first music collaboration platform, digital record label & mutual fund where artists & fans collaborate and create songs together, and where investors earn money by making this happen. Before getting into the securitization of our music royalties, I’m going to talk about our technology… We’ve built a platform that allows people from all around the globe to collaborate online through the beautiful craft of writing lyrics together, or just by writing and storing their lyrics privately. This platform is built in a way that allows us to develop internal applications like our unique music streaming service and our music encyclopedia, “Aballoopedia”. One of the best things about our platform is that it’s not only an entertainment music website where we distribute our content, it is also a space for creation & collaboration, and it functions like a social network that allows our users to share and dedicate their favorite songs from our catalog; which brings me to the next point… OUR CONTENT During the past 4 years, we’ve managed to discover and polish an outstanding formula to generate music content like no other… We have come up with a music collaboration model that even allows non-musicians to be part of music creation by writing lyrics on our platform and having well-known artists collaborate and create songs out of those lyrics through our record label, Weballooning…  And I know that you’re probably wondering what exactly is Weballooning... Weballooning is the name of our digital record label, which in other words means it is an asset generator!  Weballooning consists of arranging live music sessions where we gather musicians and artists from different bands and have them write and record a song within 48 hours, using some of the lyrics that their fans have posted on our platform. In other words, we’re the first digital record label to produce and sell music written between artists and fans. And believe me when I say that the results are mind-blowing. The sound of the songs is an unprecedented thing. We currently have more than 250,000 monthly listeners on Spotify and YouTube, and over 9.2 million plays with just 12 launched songs, and without any budget for marketing, which takes me to the next and probably the most important thing about this presentation: Music Backed Securities… We’ve already started collecting and managing music royalties out of our current songs catalog but we need liquidity to scale, That’s why after more than 2 decades of having such a financial instrument issued by David Bowie and financial innovator David Pullman, we want to retake the “Bowie Bonds” concept and turn it into the first Music Backed Securities market.  According to Billboard Magazine, Bowie Bonds were ahead of their time however, thanks to the re-emergence of the music industry and the rise of the Blockchain technology, we want to create the first financial market and mutual fund that issues and sells Asset Backed Securities collateralized by pools of songs and/or song derivatives that can serve as a new investment vehicle to be traded in our own platform or even just used as a collectible! We’ve worked and released songs with national and international famous Latin-American artists, and we’re looking to broaden our horizon by reaching out and inviting worldwide music celebrities to collaborate next. We believe that true innovation comes not only from creating great products, but creating a new mindset… That’s why for the first time ever we’re making it possible for non-musicians to be part of music creation, for big artists to collaborate and engage with their fans in a new way, and for investors to be part of the next generation of Music Backed Securities with which they’ll be able to, not only diversify their portfolios and periodically earn yields over long periods of time, but to be part of the creation of amazing music between artists and fans. Because we believe that, if a single mind has been able to create a masterpiece, imagine what we could create all together. ",,,

With PoT, all nodes have a fair chance of being selected to validate event data and participate in the consensus process on the Timechain (an ordered sequence of immutable verified event data). This contrasts with proof-of-work (PoW)-powered networks that require computationally-intensive resources to mine blocks or proof-of-stake (PoS)-enabled networks where nodes must stake enough coins.  The Analog network is the first real attempt in helping the world to move from a “timeless mess” to a “time-driven” environment via PoT consensus. Besides solving the problem of verifiability of event data, the Analog network also prioritizes interoperability. It establishes a radically decentralized, secure, and trustless layer-0 where multiple networks like Avalanche and Ethereum can anchor their transactions. Most importantly, the Analog Timegraph leverages zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to create a validated pipeline of event data that web3 developers can privately leverage to power the next generation of decentralized applications.  Unlike other Blockchain application programming interface (API) models that involve the use of third-party oracles, Analog’s Timegraph API allows data providers to become their own oracles on the Timechain. This creates an entirely new marketplace of event data that is set to power the next generation of decentralized applications (DApps).",,,

A world with new opportunities for people to evolve and enjoy their lives. A new way of working, investing, creating business and opportunities for all sectors. Let me tell you more about our work: Since the inception of blockchain, we have championed its application across all sectors as Codebooster. What started as an experiment that took place exclusively online is now changing industries and transforming the way they work forever. Blockchain technology was first introduced to the world in 2008. It is known as the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But blockchain offers more. Much more. We believe blockchain can revolutionize data management by decentralizing information storage, increasing process efficiency and, at the same time, ensuring greater security for everything from IoT (Internet of Things) devices to health records, supply chains and even government agencies. That means we have another step to go. Let me give you an example about our work with this new vision: The cannabis industry's transition to using this revolutionary technology has benefited greatly from our work with them by making it possible to conduct transactions at low cost rather than the high cost and risk of using large amounts of cash. This works through a system where data is automatically shared across devices without any human intervention, ultimately leading to transparency within these markets no longer being compromised thanks in large part to their use of distributed ledger technology: the Orion Project, also known as WID Token, is our vision for this industry, and we are already working with our own cryptocurrency, its own payment gateway and DAPP marketplace. My company has been looking at getting rid of its old concept, because didn't reflect how far the technology had come since its inception. That's why we are rebranding, so the community can see us in a new light: a more modern take on how you all have been operating for years and now it's time to step up our game! We want to show the community that we are all in this together. We need each other's help, and there is no better way to show our gratitude than through a rebranding that reflects our new perspective of life as one big ecosystem, made up of industries (Constellations) and groups within each constellation, which reference different processes within the industry that need to be optimized or changed to increase the quality of life in our communities. Say hello to Clusterfy, our new name that will replicate the world we see in front of us. Soon you will be able to visit www.clusterfy.io! Sincerely, Andrés Galmez Clusterfy Owner",,,

Our mission is to decentralize social media the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralizing the financial system. As a layer-1 blockchain, DeSo can be compared to other blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, etc... However, DeSo has several major advantages over these platforms, the largest being that it is designed to power storage-heavy applications (like social applications and marketplaces). To put it in perspective, storing just a 200-character ""Tweet"" on Ethereum costs ~$80, and costs ~$0.25-$1.00+ on Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, and virtually all other smart contract chains. In contrast, it costs 1/1,000th of a penny on DeSo, which is why breakthrough apps like Diamond, DAODAO, Pearl, OpenProsper, NFTz, and Entre, now possible exclusively on DeSo. Today, social media is even more centralized than the financial industry was prior to the creation of Bitcoin. A handful of private entities effectively control public discourse, and earn monopoly profits off of content that they don't even create. Society’s answer to financial centralization was not to put Warren Buffett in charge of money, it was to use technology, namely Bitcoin, so we could have nobody in charge. We believe the same type of technology will cause this conclusion to ultimately play out in social. DeSo’s advantages make it capable of breaking this status quo for the first time, and bringing competition and innovation back to social in much the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum have done for our financial system. Moreover, if DeSo succeeds, we will no longer need individual ""dictators"" to set a homogenous moderation policy for hundreds of millions of people.",,,

Since the dawn of agriculture, human beings have continually sought higher efficiency and security in the production and trading of food. The modern age has seen the economics of agriculture and soft commodities repeatedly transformed by sudden technical innovations, a pattern which will continue to repeat itself. In the 1850’s advancements in refrigeration and food preservation dramatically lowered food prices and increased availability. In the 1940’s innovation came in the form of gasoline tractors replacing horse drawn plows. Today, blockchain technology is poised to play a major part in the agricultural revolution of our time.  GrainChain’s patent pending solution utilizes blockchain technology to address numerous issues present within the soft commodities markets, such as fraud at all stages, large and small-scale corruption, payment delays, access to futures commodities market, and a cycle of debt that is difficult to escape.  GrainChain changes this.  GrainChain utilizes the well-known properties of blockchains to address the systemic problems present in soft commodities markets, an industry in which the GrainChain team already has first hand experience in building software solutions.  The GrainChain system greatly increases transparency and accountability within the agriculture business by eliminating disparate and wasteful paper trails, greatly eliminating the opportunity for fraud and dramatically reducing time and costs. It ensures the prompt and secure execution of contracts between farmers and buyers, by both automatically facilitating payment to the farmer and making available the corresponding financial instrument for trading on commodities markets while verifying it is backed by only real assets in the system. This shortens a process that can currently take weeks down to a nearly instantaneous one. GrainChain benefits farmers, buyers, brokers, storage facilities, banks, suppliers of agricultural goods, governments, and ultimately every food consumer on earth; everyone that benefits from a more honest and efficient agricultural indust GrainChain was first introduced in 2013 by an inventor and entrepreneur Luis Macias.",,,

For the producers and purchasers of perishable goods, Transparent Path creates the real-time, end-to-end supply chain visibility that reduces waste, cost and risk.  WHO WE ARE: Former senior executives from the food, tech and social impact sectors, from companies like Amazon, IBM, Xerox, Microsoft, Target and General Mills. We came together in 2020 to use the skills honed over long careers to create meaningful positive impact. Our social mission: to make a significant dent in the epic levels of food waste and hunger in the world.  Founded as an LLC in 2018. Restructured and started over in 2020.  PROBLEM: Supply chain disruptions continue to plague the producers and buyers of perishable goods, worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic showed us that our supply chain data systems, sill largely powered by paper, faxes and siloed systems, were incapable of handling the enormous systemic strains caused by pandemic-related labor and equipment shortages, disruptions, and growing, complex regulation. Shippers and receivers can't manage what they can't see. So we decided to combine a number of advanced technologies and new approaches for today's challenges. SOLUTION: Customers affix our continuously-connected cellular sensors to pallets entering the supply chain. These sensors constantly capture and report the location, temperature, humidity and other factors for these shipments into our visibility cloud. This platform was built with collaboration in mind. Supply chain partners are grouped in Consortiums — dynamic partnerships based around common trade relationships. Product custodies are tracked, easing data sharing and showing who's ""got the ball.""  When location or conditions jeopardize our customers' products, we send out real-time alerts to the appropriate parties who can intervene and save the shipment, along with its freshness, safety, and financial value. Finally, our proprietary algorithms unlock the value within the rich data we capture, letting us predict product freshness and transparency.   BENEFITS: At a time when runaway inflation and supply chain delays are hurting bottom lines, our customers reduce their supply chain losses, retailer rejections, insurance premiums, wasted time, and labor costs spent on reconciliations. Our customers, their customers and their supply chain partners all know exactly what's happening to products in transit — reducing disputes and improving trust. And fresh, safe and full-margin product is provided to the customer.     CUSTOMER PROFILE: Transparent Path supports the seafood, meat and tree fruit sectors. In November 2022, it added monitoring and insights for bio-medical products and construction chemicals. PARTNERSHIPS: Transparent Path has created partnerships with Intel, T-Mobile, Buildly, Tive, Thiqa (Oman), General Assembly, Duke University, and the University of Washington. Intel has donated hardware, software, and ongoing counsel since 2020. Over its short tenure, Transparent Path has been accepted into numerous accelerators, including 5G Open Innovation Lab, Microsoft for Startups, NewChip, and most recently, Plug and Play IoT.  FUNDRAISING: To date, Transparent Path has been funded via bootstrapping, two RegCF raises, and four angel investors. The company is building traction toward a Series A that will fund sales scaling and feature expansion.   Headquartered in the US, Transparent Path was founded by Eric Weaver, a 30-year enterprise transformation specialist. Prior to founding the company, Weaver launched the Xerox Customer Experience Practice, where he managed a $550M services book of business.  Please visit xparent.io to learn more.",,,

Climate change and environmental degradation are the largest existential threats to humanity in the 21st century, and also the largest economic opportunity of our time. These problems are fundamentally issues of economic coordination. Regen Network, a Techstars-backed company, is a digital platform powered by Cosmos SDK that allows farmers, brands, and institutions to make auditable ecological agreements so that we can rapidly accelerate the adoption of regenerative agriculture and reverse global climate change. Regen Network is comprised of two important parts. We are building a Proof-of-Stake blockchain focused on ecological data, assets, and agreements using the Tendermint Consensus Engine and the Cosmos SDK. Join us to help secure what we believe will be the most important distributed ledger on Earth — the ledger of ecological health and agreements. In addition to creating the underlying infrastructure necessary for ecological accounting, we’re also building real-world applications. Investing in Regen Network Now is the time to take bold action to reverse the degradation of this planet. This technology offers us an incredible opportunity to do just that. We are currently in a private pre-sale for our native staking token or offering convertible notes for equity if that is what you prefer. We will personally guide you through the investment process to make it as easy, private, and secure as possible. Token Mechanics Regen Ledger is secured through our staking token, the Regen token (XRN). XRN follows the Cosmos Proof-of-Stake consensus and token economics. By purchasing and staking XRN, you help secure this essential infrastructure and the public good it generates, plus staked tokens receive network fees and block rewards as compensation for this important work. For more detailed information please see our economics paper. Regen Network Development, Inc. is building a contracting platform utilizing Regen Ledger to make easy and accessible ecological contracts between institutions and land managers, who may not have the capacity to interact directly with the blockchain. At the center of these agreements are scientifically-robust ecological protocols that verify a change in practice or outcomes on the ground. The Market A conservative estimate of the size of the Ecosystem Service Market came in at $36 billion in 2017. We expect this to grow to $1 trillion over the next decade as climate change accelerates and businesses and governments react to the economic disruption by beginning to value currently-externalized costs. We intend to capture a significant portion of this market. Learn more about investment opportunities at https://www.regen.network/investors.html.",,,

Opporty ensures transparency and security, standardizes procedures, and creates an environment of cooperation that instills trust between parties doing business. Aspiring to become a global business marketplace and an expertise validation provider on the Blockchain, Opporty offers a solution that establishes and grows trusted business relationships globally. Opporty heavily relies on its Proof-of-Expertise protocol that, while collecting and analyzing transaction metadata, empowers Opporty’s scoring system to attach domain-relevant expertise to digital business identities and individually rank every vendor and service provider. This ecosystem allows for more secure domestic and international transactions, corporation and government procurement, and supply chain risk management. With Ethereum’s Plasma Cash Protocol as its underlying technology, Opporty has developed a permission-based version of the Opporty ecosystem called Opporty Enterprise Solution (OES). Plasma Cash protocol allows for the creation of child blockchains, which are governed by a parent blockchain. These child chains can have different consensus rules, functionality and underlying base tokens. Such extensions naturally fit with Proof-of-Expertise, with OPP as the underlying token used for manipulation, and allows for the development of private, blockchain-powered applications, such as Opporty Enterprise Solution. Given the technologies utilized, Opporty Enterprise Solution can be implemented onto third-party platforms and applications. It can be used in enclosed corporate environments that need all data to be kept private and inaccessible to third parties, outside of the system. Corporations can implement OES to enjoy safe and secure storage of transaction metadata, blockchain-based processing of transactions, privacy of selected transactions, and transaction analysis to assign scores for specific activities. Specific use cases of Opporty Enterprise Solution include: production tracking, food safety and certification, cross-border payments and clearance, supply chain visibility, automatic dispute settlement, and asset transfer.
