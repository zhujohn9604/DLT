To do this, we have modeled multiple use cases of blockchain technology and incorporated bio-metrics to package web and mobile applications.   Our primary concept is based on the development of a social validation platform on which both corporate and individual users are validated through a complete, in depth, due diligence process.  This verifies not only the identity, licensing and regulatory status of corporations and professionals but also the identities and accreditation of individuals. The aim of this process is to reduce corporate, professional and individual identity theft and associated fraud within the financial and business sectors. This will be achievable globally in a decentralized system using blockchain technology.  Fraud is on the rise every year in various market sectors and sub-sectors globally, where the rates of fraudulent activities tied to corporate or personal identity theft have risen to astronomical levels. This is in part due to the availability of information on social media platforms and other information portals.  In Proofpoints 2014 research, it was found that Fortune 100 companies are popular targets for fraud.  Approximately 40% of Facebook accounts and 20% of Twitter accounts claiming to represent a Fortune 100 brand are unauthorized.  This has permeated all sub sectors, from the asset management industry to newer sectors such as cryptocurrencies.  Currently, social media platforms are inadequate in providing account validation that requires an in-depth due diligence process to inhibit fraud and enhance legitimate business.   According to the 2016 Annual Fraud Indicator Report fraudulent activity costs were estimated to amount to Â£193 billion in the UK alone.  At Trusted In Trading, we strongly believe that we can make a significant impact on how individuals and companies are affected through the development of our feature rich social validation platform with crypto-currency based escrow capabilities.  Each company that chooses to validate their details and become part of the chain will reduce the risk of identity misuse. Moreover, they can use their verified accounts as  primary marketing channels whilst adhering to regulatory parameters established by national regulatory bodies.     Trustedâs unique selling proposition (USP) is that up to date a multi-function social validation platform which is beneficial to all members of the financial and business sectors does not exist. The current social platforms are too generalized or, in some cases, too niche.  A platform that provides features and tools for all members of the sector, from small business owners to multi-billion dollar hedge funds, will retain usage levels and appeal to a large cross section of the sectors. Not only this, but validation and escrow will improve business for those concerned. Phases 1,2,3 and 4 will be the build and launch of the startup ecosystem which will encompass, crypto, social, asset managers and entrepreneurial ecosystems in conjunction wit7h a defined road to capital.",,,

Typical third-party booking services such as Kayak and Expedia take advantage of their online monopoly and centralised systems to charge exorbitant fees to users and businesses. Hoteliers state that their rates make up as much as 25% of the booking revenue per guest. Empire Hotels has found a unique approach to creating trust in their decentralised booking system through transparent execution, and by fuelling the platform with its own crypto asset.  The Token The token, Empire Cash (EMPC), is an Ethereum based ERC-20 token which is scheduled for release in the fourth quarter of 2018. The total supply will be 367,200,000 EMPCs, of which 34% will be reserved for the ICO phase. How is Empire Hotels planning on competing against existing third-party booking platforms? Empire Hotels has a very simple answer for this â through the benefits and transparency of the blockchain. With a decentralised blockchain economy there will be direct communication and improved relationships between businesses and their guests, providing a high level of mutual trust and maximum efficiency.  The hotel industry around the world is valued at $500 billion per year, and astonishingly it is estimated that up to $125 billion is made up of unnecessary costs which are annually shared by hoteliers and guests. On Empire Hotels' decentralised platform, payments are settled on the ledger and wonât be subject to processing overheads. Plus, the platform charges lower, more reasonable fees for its service, and implements blockchain to ensure all transactions are governed by smart-contracts. The Takeaway Empire Hotels' vision for the future is a supportive ecosystem, where all users and businesses have the opportunity to truly benefit from the transparency and eradication of the high commission structures of typical online booking platforms. In addition, Empire Hotels aims to simplify actual transactions and greatly reduce security risks as all data will be decentralised and traceable, making the customer feel fully protected.",,,

Our core innovation building block, the Mattereum Asset Passport does this by eliminating information asymmetry between buyers and sellers. It precisely specifies the value-defining attributes of an asset as a series of warranted claims, where either the vendor or a third party can act as a warrantor, with a rock-solid binding between on-chain transactions and legal dispute resolution mechanism. We already have a growing pipeline of clients and lighthouse customers including gold mints, art dealers, collectible sellers and wine merchants, for whom we have completed real-world sales of high value objects. We are looking to scale our sales rapidly to address $BNs of physicals across multiple asset classes and use the knowledge graph across our asset passports to build out a powerful exchange platform with revolutionary new liquidity-enhancing functionality. From this foundation we aim to enable secondary markets to function hyper efficiently and sustainability to be accurately priced into assets, tilting manufacturing towards a circular economy, ultimately providing circularity-as-a-service to our clients.",,,

It is HCRs'â vision to make the music industry fair and transparent, through better deals for both artist and their âfanvestorsâ. For far too long, the music business has predominantly benefitted the âbigâ record companies, leaving many music artists disillusioned as profits gained from their hard and talented work are bled dry. The recent phenomenal changes within the respective worldsâ of music, technology and crowdsales have paved the way for a significantly better deal for artists, and fanvestors - everyday people who currently follow and support an artist, and want to do so in a more intimate and connected way.  The changes, such as the digitisation of music, Blockchain technology and crowdsales are what HCR have absorbed in order to create a better ecosystem for artists and fanvestors.  HCR allows artists with huge potential to retain ownership of their copyright assets and enjoy higher profits than are possible through the âtraditionalâ channels.  HCR provides each artist with a Record Deal, and through its Blockchain platform enables the artist to raise the capital required to fuel their career via an ICO - and to build a large fan base through a network effect. Not only does this speed up the fundraising process, HCR empowers artists to do what they love doing most - producing and sharing their work with the world, in the quickest time possible. Coin holders will have special privileges and access to the artist, their performances and merchandise.

We build member-owned and governed decentralised network platforms for the peer-to-peer exchange of tokenised value between network members. Our ethos and architecture is grounded in protocol, peer-to-peer architecture, removing friction and market inefficiencies, strong security guarantees and interoperable exchange across platforms to build a peer-to-peer ecosystem for market infrastructure. Our focus is capital markets; we work with firms that have the ambition to reinvent the industry's business models. Our technology is p2p network platforms and protocol first - protocol suite, software that implements those protocols and provides client software and infrastructure for p2p networks. Its based on Ethereum and we call it Autonity - the protocol, the Geth-based client. We use our technology to build p2p networks and dFMI. P2p networks are private, member-owned and governed networks that enable peer-to-peer transfer of financial value and automation of contractual and fiduciary operations without reliance on trusted third-parties. Such decentralised networks can interact with one another, creating a wider ecosystem of value and leveraging the network effect, and they can form part of a dFMI. dFMI is a new concept, one that builds on the security and resilience guarantees of distributed ledger and systems engineering to provide a platform for tokenising value and transferring its ownership between participants on that or, by cross-platform exchange, on other platforms. We believe that our technology will drive adoption of a next-generation dFMI where intermediaries are removed, incentive structures encourage self-regulation, and risks are mitigated and reduced to the maximum. dFMI doesn't just provide a cryptographically secure environment for market participants to transact, it provides a peer-to-peer model that removes financial intermediaries and engenders a wider ecosystem for value transfer across platforms and pre- post-trade processes. dFMI works to mitigate concentration and liquidity risk, reduce settlement cycles to real-time, remove friction, and lower the transaction cost of economic exchange. Clearmatics is a company with a strong belief in the open source movement and good ties to the Ethereum community. We also work closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and are an active member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA).",,,

SSI is a new paradigm for exchanging trusted digital data related to people, companies, and things in a much more secure and privacy-preserving fashion that puts people in control of their data. Far too often, digital identity services online are slow, user-hostile, and expensive for businesses to process. It costs anywhere from $10 onwards to verify the identity of people online, and upwards of $100s for corporate entities. Over the past few years many startups, established ID companies, governments, and non-profits have used decentralised identity to give people more control back of their data and make its use secure and transparent. BUT... What is currently missing is an incentives layer for the self-sovereign identity ecosystem, which hampers adoption. We use blockchain to create a decentralised network for digital identity payments. Once we build this, we will build tools to allow digital ID payments agnostic of ledger. Our initial target segment is B2B, to any companies building products on decentralised ID for people and companies. We will work with these ID companies to integrate verim's digital ID payment rails and network. Our future roadmap includes plans for enterprise and SaaS software that allows large/mid- cap organisations that want to monetise their digital ID issuance. Our mission is to make digital identity more accessible, inclusive, and commercially sustainable. Our core product is a blockchain network that makes exchanging and paying for trusted data easy, inclusive, and secure. We built this core on blockchain technology, as we believe no single company should be in control of such critical Web infrastructure. Our vision is that this new form of digital identity applies beyond just the financial industry and will be transformative for almost every industry sector imaginable. Through our network, anyone can verify identities quickly and securely with the ability for organisations checking the data to be compensated for their work.",,,

The price risk is transferred to the opposing side of the market where âMakersâ supply an alternative cryptocurrency that has a lower volatility; typically, a âstablecoinâ. Both the protected asset and the stablecoin deposited by Takers and Makers are held by the protocol in pools. Stablecoins are at risk for the benefit of Takers in the event of certain negative price events, and Taker assets incur a variable premium in the native asset for the benefit of Makers. Both the volatile cryptocurrency and stablecoin pools are partially subordinated, allowing actors to engage with the protocol according to their individual perspective on future price behaviour of the protected asset.

It uses advanced AI to combine technologies that help consumers with adaptive online and in-store personalized product recommendations, payments and deeper engagement with brands. By doing this, shopping becomes much more accessible and convenient for the shopper. âAn open and transparent shopping universe is good for customersâ Marc Lore - Walmart CEO Shopper behaviour is ever changing, to fully understand it, one must be able to get the complete overview of their shopping actions to better understand them and make suitable recommendations to meet their needs. The best way to get this overview is to understand their shopping habits online, offline, with small brands and large brands, locally and if possible globally. It has so far been impossible to combine products from small and big brands available online and in-store into one marketplace. By combining small and big brands, all retail can potentially be catalogued so that everything a shopper needs to buy online and in-store can be found and purchased in one place. This biggest problem with combining small and large retailersâ online and in-store product information is consumer expectation from both are very distinct, to be able to combine both would mean, all these expectations must be exceeded. âAtHashtags has figured a way to combine all retail into one marketplace using advanced AI.â Consumers seamlessly discover and make payment for products from smallest to largest brands online and in-person using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), connected online and in-person marketplaces (connected malls, pop up shops, retail stores) supported by an innovative proprietary payment system (Point of sale â POS). âThe vision is to bridge the massive gap between online and offline shopping between consumer, small and large brands regarding discovery, purchase especially payments for small brands, spaces and fulfilment to create an open world of seamless shopping.â   Using a unique AI algorithm called ASH to solve the problem 80% of shoppers have which is wasting a lot of time searching by combining items from small and big brands (the way they shop in the real world), helping them find these items online, leading them to physical stores near them to buy, click and collect. For small brands, it solves the problem of consumer confidence and trust with enhanced seamless discovery and deeper engagement online and in-store. It does this by allowing them to appear in multiple connected physical stores and marketplaces to bring them in closer proximity to shoppers and help them scale faster.  The proprietary payment system supports seamless payments for ATHASHTAGS consumers online and in-stores. This makes it possible for brands to only need one inventory and point of sale system for their global sales. Big brands benefit from adding more online and footfall sales, smaller brands products get cross promoted and is proven to increase sales. ATHASHTAGS app is a smart AI powered augmented reality (AR)shopping browser with image, product and facial recognition scanners combined with 3D visualisations. The proprietary AI algorithm called ASH (Augmented Search Hashtags) personalises usersâ shop pages to items they will most likely buy and content most suited to them. This AI measures proximity, previous purchases, views what their followers and following have bought, increasing consumer confidence, spend, minimising returns and need to refund. A strong leader in the AI and Payments space. We envision a world where a shopper has no boundaries locally and globally on what they can acquire and the immediacy of receiving their orders.
