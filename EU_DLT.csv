The core business lies in the certification and authentication ofphysical products and it is based on the security and transparency of blockchain technology combined with the privacy of private records to offer an efficient hybrid solution. The entire platform is structured as a product management marketplace. Blockchain technology is used by ANIMA for the purposes of tracking, authentication of physical products and digital sales. Once the design products to be digitized have been selected with partners; ANIMA creates a token in blockchain by matching it with a digital certificate representing a physical asset. This certificate takes on the value of the digital identity of the product itself; it represents its guarantee, enhances its creative process, history and tracks its movements.  Thanks to the ANIMA platform, users will be able to store their digital products and derive all possible information from them. In fact, within the digital certificate will be countless data and information regarding the product to make the identity of the good even more specific.  By combining QR code functionality with blockchain functionality, ANIMA has come up with a new function: the ""Scan To Own""; every user who scans the QR code will redeem ownership of the digital product related to the physical product. Thanks to this kind of function, the steps the product takes will be certified with every movement. The technology that ANIMA has designed turns out to be highly scalable; in the near future we expect to be able to easily adapt and scale our innovative solution to any other type of business sector",,,

For now the Big Time is being enlarged by introduction of the blockchain technologies in the services we provide and starting new directions so that the platform will further include: -	Publication and patenting provider is a service that allows a safe transfer of the specific scientific study to a platform for translation, editing, formatting and further publication in scientific journals, as well as assistance in foreign patenting services -	Media Agency is an innovative platform that covers all areas of translation services, including legal, scientific, medical, literary, industrial, etc. -	Crowdfunding platform to raise funds for translation and publication of books, scientific materials, research conduct, organization of publishing houses and conferences etc. -	Sponsoring the research of scientists – scientists can offer their ideas and best practices, patents and other materials at any stage of preparation, describe their MVPs and attract investments to implement their plans -	Database of scientific publications – a decentralized repository of scientific innovations, researches and developments in the world of science, which enables access to all knowledge represented in the most renowned and reviewed scientific journals -	MarketPlace is a platform that will allow each user to sell their best practices or research or to buy what is offered for sale, as well as find necessary services for its own use at any location of the world Our blockchain web-site: big-time.io Main site with a 7-year-old sustainable business model: wos-scopus.eu (Europe) and wos-scopus.com (CIS countries) where you may see dozens of positive feedbacks from real clients.  For the time being, Michael Levitt, a 2013 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, joined our advisory board as a respectable person from the scientific community itself, where we are implementing the technology of blockchain in science and thereby expanding the current business by means of starting ICO. Not very clear what kind of current problem the blockchain solves? Let me explain - when sending materials of scientific papers for their consideration and possible publication in scientific journals etc., the intellectual property of the scientist can be borrowed and left unprotected from the theft. In addition, our aggregator combines genius minds from different countries, which eventually can produce a brilliant discovery, but each one set a high value on the best practices on each side (e.g., when a scientist from Germany cooperates with a scientist from Japan). The findings are required to be shared under someone's consolidation. That is - the first problem that decides blockchain - the transfer of intellectual property at a certain point in time and its validation and consolidation for each of the owners. Similarly, we can talk about patenting of inventions and other materials. We are also engaged in this business.",,,

By moving between the client and the crypto custody provider, we address multiple layers of pain. It is essential to note that DECUS never handles the private keys of the clients. The private keys of the client remain at the custodian. The private keys to access the wallets of the custodian are placed in a client module to which only the client has access. A client triggers a transaction via the DECUS interfaces. After a transaction is triggered, an unsigned call is sent from the DECUS backend to the client module. The client can now authorise this transaction with the private keys stored in the module. If a transaction is successfully authorised, the call is signed and sent back to the DECUS backend forwarded to the custodian. The custodian executes the transaction.     There are three crucial reasons why a client should use several crypto custody providers. First, every system is hackable, regardless of its security standards. This implied cost of cyber vulnerability can only be addressed by spreading funds across systems. Also, a provider might run into issues independent from external forces. Such provider failure can cause downtimes resulting in the clients' inability to access funds.    Additionally, a client might experience a ""lock-in syndrome"". A lock-in occurs if a client has integrated a single provider, but the provider fails to meet the expectations or the needs of the client change. However, due to switching costs or contractual agreements, a provider switch is difficult.    Furthermore, due to different technologies in crypto custody, different providers come with different advantages and disadvantages. Consider the trade-off between hot and cold storage. The first offers high speed while the last offers higher security but at the cost of considerably higher latency.    Considering these different layers of pain, DECUS Networks is helping clients to fix all these pains with a single tool. Instead of integrating one custodian, a client integrates the DECUS Network of custodians.

Our solution reveals forgery and falsification of images and videos with high accuracy. Images and videos that were taken out of context and reused with modified metadata, so called shallow fakes have been around for some time, however the advancement of AI and wide availability of CPU/GPU power has enabled bad actors to easily forge videos, that are nearly indistinguishable from real ones and can be used for malicious and unethical purposes. Videos have been regarded as proof that something has happened; however, today anyone can swap faces of politicians or other people just by following a step-by-step guide available online. With time, this will only get easier and videos like these can spread like wildfire on social media, just like fake news in 2016, but now on steroids, in the form of fake videos. This could possibly happen already in 2020, just in time for the next US elections. Our solution allows media outlets (online, TV, news agencies, journalists) and platforms (social media sites, video sharing platforms and websites) to check the authenticity of images and videos, preventing misinformation of the public and all unwanted consequences related to forged content.

It was founded in March 2017 in Maastricht, Netherlands. Through its cryptocurrency (DCN) and a set of incentivized software tools, the Foundation has managed to create a new dental ecosystem which favours all industry stakeholders: patients, dentists, manufacturers, suppliers, labs, insurance companies. The core purpose of the Foundation is to improve long-term health, reduce costs and pain, and continuously support the growth in the value of DCN. Dentacoin owes its existence to the joint efforts of a group of like-minded dentistry and digital transformation experts eager to reshape the dental industry by adopting integrated, Blockchain-based technologies. The Foundation is backed by a vast community of progressive dentists committed to moving the focus from acute treatment to sustainable prevention in the interest of all people. Dentacoin is the one and only cryptocurrency in the world that connects all participants in the global dental industry. In contrast to the inflation-prone world currencies, it holds the potential to make people richer rather than poorer. In its essence, Dеntacoin has a strong social aspect - it empowers people to receive affordable and sustainable dental care and to earn additional income for their active usage of Dentacoin Apps. The Blockchain-based software tools developed by the Dentacoin Foundation are a means of distributing DCN cryptocurrency to the key end users (i.e. patients, dentists, manufacturers). In return for writing reviews about their dentist (Trusted Reviews Platform), taking dental surveys (DentaVox), and maintaining excellent oral hygiene (Dentacare Mobile dApp), they receive different amounts of DCN. Thus, people within Dentacoin Ecosystem are encouraged to contribute to the improvement of dental care both on a personal and global level. The next milestone on Dentacoin’s roadmap is the development of another two Blockchain-based applications - a revolutionary insurance-like model called Dentacoin Assurance, with its testnet already released and a secure, patient-managed Health Database.",,,

The fundamental value proposition of Intalex is to leverage the power of our secure, robust and regulated platform to create a new global market for recruitment agencies and employers to trade directly with each other, thereby allowing them to benefit from the global demand and supply imbalance rather than struggle with it, as is currently the case. The exchange connects recruitment professionals and employers from around the world on a single trading access point, creating an exclusive and enclosed market for Intalex members to trade their candidates and jobs directly. We believe our platform will change the face of how companies recruit talent from both a cost and time perspective. Intalex shrinks the globe, country and individual city markets and enables the smallest agency to compete with the largest agent, for mutual benefit and transaction success. Conversely, the Intalex platform also helps large, global employers with niche aggregated talent supply chain of global and specialist recruiters. Not only will the employer have access to the world’s best talent, they will also benefit from paying less for that talent through our unique reverse auction facility. For employers, Intalex seeks to disrupt the current cost model of recruitment by inverting it, putting the pricing control back into their hands. Intalex is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, which is regarded as Europe’s technology hub, with a further sales and marketing office in San Francisco.  Given Ireland’s proximity to both Europe and the USA, we believe we are ideally positioned to serve these markets.

Gaps in supply chain monitoring create vulnerabilities due to a lack of data distribution infrastructure. This causes supply chain management risks resulting in large overhead, compliance, audit, and error costs. This can be illustrated by numerous traceability issues and recalls causing: large amounts of waste, reduced consumer trust in products, and demand for increased transparency. In addition, food fraud and counterfeiting results in millions of people becoming ill and even the loss of lives in addition to immense economic losses. Other well-known issues in many supply chains include inventory management and demand prediction difficulties, resulting in excess working capital requirements. Legacy systems are focused on optimizing the internal operations of a company but fail to encompass the supply chain as a whole. This by default rules out the possibility of implementing solutions that require coordination and data sharing among the relevant stakeholders. Unova proposes a novel approach for supply chain data distribution, coordination, and innovation based on web3. It is a trustless infrastructure leveraging smart contracts and blockchain technology, allowing for cutting-edge applications built on decentralized web software protocols. More specifically, Unova is a blockchain network for supply chain management using a protocol that leverages privacy-enabled data distribution, cross-cluster distribution, and a multi-layered architecture.

We currently consist of Thimo Buchheister and Thorsten Brügge, who have been working together as software engineers for a long time and who decided in 2019 to make the world of digital processes accessible to everyone. As CEO, Thimo Buchheister is currently primarily involved in the development of our ThreeNamic platform. With his many years of experience as a software engineer and in-depth knowledge of mobile and cloud development, software engineering, databases, blockchain and IT project management, he has an overview of the big picture and always keeps the company and our products at the forefront of current technologies. As COO, Thorsten Bruges is our creative and communicative mind. He is responsible for the development of our products and is in constant contact with our customers and partners. With his experience in machine learning, he is also responsible for the automation of ThreeNamic's processes. Through his experience in industry and in sales, Thorsten has an important perspective on the necessary functionality of our products and advises our customers on all aspects of our products, projects and the company. There are a number of software solutions on the market that support entrepreneurs in capturing the data necessary for their everyday work and making adjustments. Most offers here have in common that the user has to submit to the procedures prescribed by the program or that the software only displays a snapshot. Our vision is software that can be adapted to the needs of the user and that also accompanies and documents the entire process. We would also like to create the possibility of accessing the processes from anywhere in order to enable modern and location-independent work. Today this is only possible if an entrepreneur can raise the necessary capital to have customized software programmed. With ThreeNamic, we want to give every entrepreneur - regardless of type and size - the opportunity to adapt a software solution to their needs. Our customers should concentrate on their core competencies and know that our software is the perfect digital partner by their side. In many conversations we have heard that digital developments in many companies are still in their infancy and that those responsible are facing major challenges. Most companies already have processes that have proven themselves over long periods of time. The introduction of new software is then not only the transfer of data into a new system, but in most cases also an adaptation of current processes to the processes specified by the new system. We want to be the solution here. Our goal is to enable every company to become more efficient with the help of digitization. We enable the smallest start-up to the largest company to digitize all corporate processes on a global scale and thus work more effectively, transparently and securely. Starting with training for customers and employees, the planning and organization of events or meetings, through the digitization of training and further education to the complete automation of critical company processes, with ThreeNamic we have the appropriate solution.",,,

That means players’ performance directly affects the NFT face value (more about that below). Unlike some play-to-earn NFT-gamified/NFT-infused games, in Snook the players' in-game character IS an NFT, with your skill and gameplay achievements immutably recorded on chain. This snook-NFT, your game character, as long as it does not die, can be played in future games. It also retains value as a digital asset and collectible on the secondary market. Snook is the first game in a new NFT crypto-space – one that determines the face-value and affects the market value of NFTs through measurement of skilled ""work"" invested in their creation and development. It's a crypto meritocracy and similar to that thing your parents used to say: 'if you work hard and apply yourself, you'll reap the rewards'…  This merger between a relatively new, decentralized, trust-agnostic, and immutable economic paradigm and one of humanity’s most popular pass-time - gaming - is surprisingly natural and seamless. Players spend time playing. They develop skills with patience and persistence. Until today, their efforts were measured in their score, ranking and/or character evolution. Rewards were emotional and social. It felt good, and you got ""street cred"". However, like all economies, if one invests work/effort/energy in something, it should be possible to exchange the ""fruits"" of that labor with other things that also store value. Those could be money (e.g., Fiat or FT/cryptocurrencies), commodities (which are still fungible, i.e., they are the same and replacing one with another does not affect its value), or non-fungible items (e.g., NFTs). Which leads us to Snook – a game that allows players to monetize their performance and capture their unique gaming achievements in their NFTs.  Moreover, Snook makes certain achievements especially difficult to realize, allowing exceptional players to monetize their skill. As such, Snook is a steppingstone towards: As such, Snook is a steppingstone towards:  - Curtailing inflation in the NFT market by providing a value metric that is not only based on buzz and speculation. - Bringing the cryptocurrency and blockchain economy and ecosystem closer to mainstream economy and day-to-day transactions - Realizing a working model for capturing the value of skill and performance Whitepaper: https://whitepaper.snook.gg/",,,

In “Ranked Mode” tournaments, only the best players will share the rewards (RCN token) and make profit. The higher you rank, the more you will participate in major tournaments. The RCN prizes up for grabs increase as the level of the tournament in which you participate increases. THE GAME Raccoon Fantasy is a collectible and customizable one-on-one card game: - 4x4 arena - Turn based - Best of 3 - NFTs NFTs - Game cards are player-owned NFTs. As such they are unique and can be put on sale in the shop. - Magic, materials and potions are used to increase the value of the cards or to fuse cards together. - In the shop you can buy new Raccoon cards or put them on sale. You can also buy materials, potions and wearable NFTs for the metaverse. METAVERSE Each land has a defined maximum Raccoon capacity. Raccoons placed on your grounds cannot be used in game decks, as they are engaged in mining RCN. In the lands you will be able to meet and interact with other players in the future and they will be the beginning of the Raccoon Fantasy metaverse. Lands can be purchased in ETH or USD. The lands are plots of land based on NFT technology and can be sold on the marketplace. TOKENOMICS The economy of our ecosystem will be based on two types of trading currencies: - $RCN, utility and governance token. $RCNs will be released with a predetermined schedule over the 60 months following the TGE. - $UVA, in-game token. The $UVA tokens will be assets derived from the farming of the $RCN token through the liquidity providing mechanism. Providing liquidity to pools generates $UVA tokens that can be used to unlock unique NFTs.

Users are encouraged to create true communities inside the network, based on common interests. In these communities, they can grow together and further develop their passions with the help of relevant and nourishing content. Only by helping others develop you can truly evolve. ★ Use Qooiver to: - Share photos and videos relevant to your interests that grab the attention of your peers - Post as many pictures as you like to drive the interaction and develop a community around your common interests - Use the chat to discuss, exchange ideas and information with like-minded people  - Gain notoriety and followers by posting the most interesting content for your interests - Follow top posters to get the best content for the things you love ★ How does Qooiver work? Qooiver has two important components that help us create relevance: the “/” tag and the ”#” tag. All content is categorized by those two tags. The “/” tag represents your passion and provides you with the possibility to create true communities around that passion. By having people with common interests collaborate we offer the possibility for them to develop in an enjoyable manner. The “#” tag is meant to bring more relevance to your passion by narrowing down, pinpointing to the precise aspects of that category that you enjoy or you’re more interested in. Qooiver drops the classic “friends relation” approach in favor of a less restrictive one. You’re free to follow whomever you consider to be a role model of your community. By offering users relevant content and reliving them from classic social relationship constraints we allow them to truly express and develop. Users can join or create their own communities right from the start enjoying the desired content right away. The “/” and “#” also allows us to provide a powerful search and filtering tool for the user to find relevant content or help them expand and find new passions. Most current social network users are being driven away by the noise and repetitive content out there. To solve these problems most social networks are now trying to break this paradigm and strive towards relevance. We’re also trying to achieve this through Qooiver. ★ Join our growing community and help us change the world! Check out our videos at: https://youtu.be/eCLLZ_t9uvI",,,

However, the biggest issue in the cryptocurrency market is the lack of transparency and authentic information. Researching a company could take days, even weeks and it’s not guaranteed that investors will find any valuable data. We understand how difficult it is to spend time following all market changes and projects’ development that are necessary to make a good investment. This is why we strive to give not only in-depth analyses but also a different independent perspective that investors can rely on and profit from. Otcrit will be their personal advisor and portfolio manager they can reach anytime, anywhere.  At the moment individuals are issuing tokens with no business plans or actual prospects for realizing their ideas and most of them are reviewed by unexperienced and biased people that are usually endorsed for it. Exchanges only list companies that can afford their extremely high entry fees and don’t care about the assets being traded. Our solution is to make this process easier, faster and more professional. The platform allows serious investors to receive expert reports for the projects and companies they are interested in. It also gives less experienced users the opportunity to get their hands on easy to understand material and not gamble with their money. We offer days and even weeks of quality research including company assessments and audit reports. These papers will be published not only in English, but in Russian, Chinese, Japanese, German and we’ll add more languages in the future. Everyone will have a quick and easy access anywhere in the world. No time wasted - only crucial information.  The Otcrit platform also has its own cryptocurrency exchange in development where only projects audited by our certified partners will be available for trading. A percentage of the profit from the collected fees will be distributed between all OTC token holders. The OEX will also pay commissions to all companies listed on it and by doing so reward them for their transparency. We are against the current model where companies are required to pay, in some cases hundreds of thousands of dollars, to be listed on other exchanges and not even get a share of the profits.",,,

Currently, we are finishing the development of our new version of the platform, that has been significantly improved (given high bounce rates of prior beta versions). The new designs of the platform were done according to the latest UI/UX trends by an ex-Wolt graphic designer and would help us successfully and effectively attract more users to the platform. Additionally, we plan to start programming our “rewards” system, where students will have an opportunity to earn money  (average €50-€100 per month), once any given positive improvements (in marks, tests, exams) are tracked.",,,

The new application can be used to directly buy or sell a home, rent a property out, get financing for a property by means of crowdfunding or even to invest in real estate projects. At the moment, the purchase and sale of a property is not always clear. What are the total costs including taxes, surcharges and let’s not forget the costs of the real estate agents. If all this information was stored in a free and public accessible library like a blockchain the costs -and risks- involved with purchasing a home would go down.   MarbCoin is working on such an app based on blockchain technology, including ""Smart Contracts"",   a smart contract is like a digital contract. For example a seller can list a property, and any interested party can directly place an offer. If the owner agrees (after optional negotiations) the app creates a standard contract.  And the buyer can create a crowdfunding contract to pay for the property and pay the owner in MarbCoins. If needed, these MarbCoins are easily converted in non-crypto currency. More information is expected to be released following an investor’s event on September 21, in Marbella Spain. ",,,

The ultimate decentralized company. -Academy: there are already many blockchain/nfts/metaverse academies but all in a traditional format without practical use of technology as such, that is why LearnDAO, in addition to the traditional format, brings training FROM the Metaverse as a novelty, entering with a token gating system to through NFTs that are purchased with the DAO token, thus giving use to the token. There is a big problem in the industry and it is that the events on the Metaverse are in person without meeting needs such as the elimination of geographical barriers and saving money and time; That is why LearnDAO launches its line of ""Metaverse World Summit"" events developed entirely from the metaverse with the ability to host up to 10,000 users (in collaboration with Vatom) in the same virtual space, also using the token through the same system. of token gating and NFT tickets purchased with the DAO token. We are developing the first e-commerce on the different platforms of the metaverse, this line of business of the DAO is with more long-term vision to position ourselves before anyone else and when there really is a volume of global purchases in the metaverse, take advantage of the new trend . Also giving use to our token by buying items through it. On the other hand, all those NFT tickets need to be traded on a marketplace platform and that is why we also launched our own NFT marketplace with a variant of it that focuses exclusively on NFT items from the metaverse (like Sketchfab but NFTized), giving the possibility for any member of the DAO to list complete 3D rooms even for someone to buy it and place it on their land in the compatible metaverse(s) in question. We believe in the power of the community and that is why we want to empower ours by creating a launchpad in which DAO member projects can launch (after a selection vote by the DAO) In addition to these business models, we have the almost mandatory governance and voting platform in any DAO, and a token staking model to encourage long-term holding. The token is also deflationary, increasing its value over time. In addition to these business models, we want to be one of the first crypto ecosystems to carry out a corporate social responsibility model, through a small fee in each transaction (1-2% of each purchase or sale will be converted to BUSD and will pass to an RSC wallet), we are going to carry out a model of buying NFTs that are worthless or belong to scams because we believe that there is a big problem in the NFT sector since we are experiencing a superinflation of useless NFTs, the prices will be symbolic but they will return part of what was lost to any person who is part of the DAO or not, with all those useless NFTs we will burn them at a given moment and form a single mural NFT with all of them, the largest NFT made up of useless NFTs or scam of the world, and we will take it to auction, thus adding value to the entire NFT sector and generating a good marketing campaign for our ecosystem through said action. Conclusion: why invest in LearnDAO and not in any metaverse platform such as decentraland, sandbox or others? because over the years they will become obsolete and most users will be on more current platforms; our ecosystem by developing ON the main metaverses and being dynamic allows us to adapt at all times to new trends.",,,

Ensuring compliance often means considerable delay, with significant costs for service providers and deep frustration for genuine would-be customers. The issue is especially challenging for global firms that have to meet diverse compliance regulations in the various jurisdictions they operate in, where, in extreme cases, it can delay verification by up to 30 to 50 days. As a result, genuine clients experience frustration in securing the services they desire. All too often KYC & AML requirements also serve to reinforce social exclusion of citizens and hinder integration efforts by reducing, or effectively even blocking, access to basic services such as the ownership of a bank account. It is calculated that up to 165 million people in Europe, including 40 million within the EU, still lack access to formal financial services, while the high cost of verification of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for new migrants is prohibitive. Many people are unable to receive benefits from the government digitally, including social security, basic health care, and even education. Lack of identification is particularly a hindrance to legal migration to other countries, and to receive remittances internationally through formal channels. KnowMeNow is committed to addressing these problems, harnessing the power of the blockchain to deliver more efficient, more secure and more reliable ways of verifying and sharing data. Our solution has the ability to greatly reduce current delays, costs, and duplication of effort, that may be caused by clients having to repeatedly produce information for verification purposes, every time a user attempts to secure services with new providers across many different sectors.",,,

To do this, we have modeled multiple use cases of blockchain technology and incorporated bio-metrics to package web and mobile applications.   Our primary concept is based on the development of a social validation platform on which both corporate and individual users are validated through a complete, in depth, due diligence process.  This verifies not only the identity, licensing and regulatory status of corporations and professionals but also the identities and accreditation of individuals. The aim of this process is to reduce corporate, professional and individual identity theft and associated fraud within the financial and business sectors. This will be achievable globally in a decentralized system using blockchain technology.  Fraud is on the rise every year in various market sectors and sub-sectors globally, where the rates of fraudulent activities tied to corporate or personal identity theft have risen to astronomical levels. This is in part due to the availability of information on social media platforms and other information portals.  In Proofpoints 2014 research, it was found that Fortune 100 companies are popular targets for fraud.  Approximately 40% of Facebook accounts and 20% of Twitter accounts claiming to represent a Fortune 100 brand are unauthorized.  This has permeated all sub sectors, from the asset management industry to newer sectors such as cryptocurrencies.  Currently, social media platforms are inadequate in providing account validation that requires an in-depth due diligence process to inhibit fraud and enhance legitimate business.   According to the 2016 Annual Fraud Indicator Report fraudulent activity costs were estimated to amount to £193 billion in the UK alone.  At Trusted In Trading, we strongly believe that we can make a significant impact on how individuals and companies are affected through the development of our feature rich social validation platform with crypto-currency based escrow capabilities.  Each company that chooses to validate their details and become part of the chain will reduce the risk of identity misuse. Moreover, they can use their verified accounts as  primary marketing channels whilst adhering to regulatory parameters established by national regulatory bodies.     Trusted’s unique selling proposition (USP) is that up to date a multi-function social validation platform which is beneficial to all members of the financial and business sectors does not exist. The current social platforms are too generalized or, in some cases, too niche.  A platform that provides features and tools for all members of the sector, from small business owners to multi-billion dollar hedge funds, will retain usage levels and appeal to a large cross section of the sectors. Not only this, but validation and escrow will improve business for those concerned. Phases 1,2,3 and 4 will be the build and launch of the startup ecosystem which will encompass, crypto, social, asset managers and entrepreneurial ecosystems in conjunction wit7h a defined road to capital.",,,

Typical third-party booking services such as Kayak and Expedia take advantage of their online monopoly and centralised systems to charge exorbitant fees to users and businesses. Hoteliers state that their rates make up as much as 25% of the booking revenue per guest. Empire Hotels has found a unique approach to creating trust in their decentralised booking system through transparent execution, and by fuelling the platform with its own crypto asset.  The Token The token, Empire Cash (EMPC), is an Ethereum based ERC-20 token which is scheduled for release in the fourth quarter of 2018. The total supply will be 367,200,000 EMPCs, of which 34% will be reserved for the ICO phase. How is Empire Hotels planning on competing against existing third-party booking platforms? Empire Hotels has a very simple answer for this – through the benefits and transparency of the blockchain. With a decentralised blockchain economy there will be direct communication and improved relationships between businesses and their guests, providing a high level of mutual trust and maximum efficiency.  The hotel industry around the world is valued at $500 billion per year, and astonishingly it is estimated that up to $125 billion is made up of unnecessary costs which are annually shared by hoteliers and guests. On Empire Hotels' decentralised platform, payments are settled on the ledger and won’t be subject to processing overheads. Plus, the platform charges lower, more reasonable fees for its service, and implements blockchain to ensure all transactions are governed by smart-contracts. The Takeaway Empire Hotels' vision for the future is a supportive ecosystem, where all users and businesses have the opportunity to truly benefit from the transparency and eradication of the high commission structures of typical online booking platforms. In addition, Empire Hotels aims to simplify actual transactions and greatly reduce security risks as all data will be decentralised and traceable, making the customer feel fully protected.",,,

HCR has built its own Blockchain-enabled platform that allows music artists to retain ownership of their copyright assets, raise capital through ICOs to fuel their careers, and to build and engage a large fan base through a network effect. It is HCRs'​ vision to make the music industry fair and transparent, through better deals for both artist and their ‘fanvestors’. For far too long, the music business has predominantly benefitted the ‘big’ record companies, leaving many music artists disillusioned as profits gained from their hard and talented work are bled dry. The recent phenomenal changes within the respective worlds’ of music, technology and crowdsales have paved the way for a significantly better deal for artists, and fanvestors - everyday people who currently follow and support an artist, and want to do so in a more intimate and connected way.  The changes, such as the digitisation of music, Blockchain technology and crowdsales are what HCR have absorbed in order to create a better ecosystem for artists and fanvestors.  HCR allows artists with huge potential to retain ownership of their copyright assets and enjoy higher profits than are possible through the ‘traditional’ channels.  HCR provides each artist with a Record Deal, and through its Blockchain platform enables the artist to raise the capital required to fuel their career via an ICO - and to build a large fan base through a network effect. Not only does this speed up the fundraising process, HCR empowers artists to do what they love doing most - producing and sharing their work with the world, in the quickest time possible. Coin holders will have special privileges and access to the artist, their performances and merchandise.  By harmonising the partnership of artists and investors and in democratising the industry, HCR offers a refreshingly different approach in bringing artists’ music to the masses. ",,,

The marketplace relying on Fieldcoin tokens, the so-called “Earth’s Metaverse”, will enable exchange, ownership verification, promotion, creation and data storing of Non-Fungible-Tokens representing real world properties. On top of that, the platform will enable the users to see their own properties on a digital map and to earn rewards by staking them.

For example we give users the chance to review wallets, exchanges or mining solutions for the benefit of other users.

We build member-owned and governed decentralised network platforms for the peer-to-peer exchange of tokenised value between network members. Our ethos and architecture is grounded in protocol, peer-to-peer architecture, removing friction and market inefficiencies, strong security guarantees and interoperable exchange across platforms to build a peer-to-peer ecosystem for market infrastructure. Our focus is capital markets; we work with firms that have the ambition to reinvent the industry's business models. Our technology is p2p network platforms and protocol first - protocol suite, software that implements those protocols and provides client software and infrastructure for p2p networks. Its based on Ethereum and we call it Autonity - the protocol, the Geth-based client. We use our technology to build p2p networks and dFMI. P2p networks are private, member-owned and governed networks that enable peer-to-peer transfer of financial value and automation of contractual and fiduciary operations without reliance on trusted third-parties. Such decentralised networks can interact with one another, creating a wider ecosystem of value and leveraging the network effect, and they can form part of a dFMI. dFMI is a new concept, one that builds on the security and resilience guarantees of distributed ledger and systems engineering to provide a platform for tokenising value and transferring its ownership between participants on that or, by cross-platform exchange, on other platforms. We believe that our technology will drive adoption of a next-generation dFMI where intermediaries are removed, incentive structures encourage self-regulation, and risks are mitigated and reduced to the maximum. dFMI doesn't just provide a cryptographically secure environment for market participants to transact, it provides a peer-to-peer model that removes financial intermediaries and engenders a wider ecosystem for value transfer across platforms and pre- post-trade processes. dFMI works to mitigate concentration and liquidity risk, reduce settlement cycles to real-time, remove friction, and lower the transaction cost of economic exchange. Clearmatics is a company with a strong belief in the open source movement and good ties to the Ethereum community. We also work closely with the Ethereum Foundation, and are an active member of the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA).",,,

SSI is a new paradigm for exchanging trusted digital data related to people, companies, and things in a much more secure and privacy-preserving fashion that puts people in control of their data. Far too often, digital identity services online are slow, user-hostile, and expensive for businesses to process. It costs anywhere from $10 onwards to verify the identity of people online, and upwards of $100s for corporate entities. Over the past few years many startups, established ID companies, governments, and non-profits have used decentralised identity to give people more control back of their data and make its use secure and transparent. BUT... What is currently missing is an incentives layer for the self-sovereign identity ecosystem, which hampers adoption. We use blockchain to create a decentralised network for digital identity payments. Once we build this, we will build tools to allow digital ID payments agnostic of ledger. Our initial target segment is B2B, to any companies building products on decentralised ID for people and companies. We will work with these ID companies to integrate verim's digital ID payment rails and network. Our future roadmap includes plans for enterprise and SaaS software that allows large/mid- cap organisations that want to monetise their digital ID issuance. Our mission is to make digital identity more accessible, inclusive, and commercially sustainable. Our core product is a blockchain network that makes exchanging and paying for trusted data easy, inclusive, and secure. We built this core on blockchain technology, as we believe no single company should be in control of such critical Web infrastructure. Our vision is that this new form of digital identity applies beyond just the financial industry and will be transformative for almost every industry sector imaginable. Through our network, anyone can verify identities quickly and securely with the ability for organisations checking the data to be compensated for their work.",,,

The price risk is transferred to the opposing side of the market where “Makers” supply an alternative cryptocurrency that has a lower volatility; typically, a “stablecoin”. Both the protected asset and the stablecoin deposited by Takers and Makers are held by the protocol in pools. Stablecoins are at risk for the benefit of Takers in the event of certain negative price events, and Taker assets incur a variable premium in the native asset for the benefit of Makers. Both the volatile cryptocurrency and stablecoin pools are partially subordinated, allowing actors to engage with the protocol according to their individual perspective on future price behaviour of the protected asset. The Bumper design demonstrates how a decentralised software marketplace for asset price risk might prove superior to more traditional methods of using centralised stop-loss (which incurs slippage), or options markets (which has parasitic profits and overheads), by re-organising the utilities of the market participants.",,,

It uses advanced AI to combine technologies that help consumers with adaptive online and in-store personalized product recommendations, payments and deeper engagement with brands. By doing this, shopping becomes much more accessible and convenient for the shopper. “An open and transparent shopping universe is good for customers” Marc Lore - Walmart CEO Shopper behaviour is ever changing, to fully understand it, one must be able to get the complete overview of their shopping actions to better understand them and make suitable recommendations to meet their needs. The best way to get this overview is to understand their shopping habits online, offline, with small brands and large brands, locally and if possible globally. It has so far been impossible to combine products from small and big brands available online and in-store into one marketplace. By combining small and big brands, all retail can potentially be catalogued so that everything a shopper needs to buy online and in-store can be found and purchased in one place. This biggest problem with combining small and large retailers’ online and in-store product information is consumer expectation from both are very distinct, to be able to combine both would mean, all these expectations must be exceeded. “AtHashtags has figured a way to combine all retail into one marketplace using advanced AI.” Consumers seamlessly discover and make payment for products from smallest to largest brands online and in-person using artificial intelligence (AI), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), connected online and in-person marketplaces (connected malls, pop up shops, retail stores) supported by an innovative proprietary payment system (Point of sale – POS). “The vision is to bridge the massive gap between online and offline shopping between consumer, small and large brands regarding discovery, purchase especially payments for small brands, spaces and fulfilment to create an open world of seamless shopping.”   Using a unique AI algorithm called ASH to solve the problem 80% of shoppers have which is wasting a lot of time searching by combining items from small and big brands (the way they shop in the real world), helping them find these items online, leading them to physical stores near them to buy, click and collect. For small brands, it solves the problem of consumer confidence and trust with enhanced seamless discovery and deeper engagement online and in-store. It does this by allowing them to appear in multiple connected physical stores and marketplaces to bring them in closer proximity to shoppers and help them scale faster.  The proprietary payment system supports seamless payments for ATHASHTAGS consumers online and in-stores. This makes it possible for brands to only need one inventory and point of sale system for their global sales. Big brands benefit from adding more online and footfall sales, smaller brands products get cross promoted and is proven to increase sales. ATHASHTAGS app is a smart AI powered augmented reality (AR)shopping browser with image, product and facial recognition scanners combined with 3D visualisations. The proprietary AI algorithm called ASH (Augmented Search Hashtags) personalises users’ shop pages to items they will most likely buy and content most suited to them. This AI measures proximity, previous purchases, views what their followers and following have bought, increasing consumer confidence, spend, minimising returns and need to refund. A strong leader in the AI and Payments space. We envision a world where a shopper has no boundaries locally and globally on what they can acquire and the immediacy of receiving their orders.
